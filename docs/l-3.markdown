## Big Picture

In this lecture, we learned about the cross product and how to compute it, and how to compute surface integrals by summing small parallelograms together.

---

## Mechanics

We learned a formula for the cross product, given by  

$$
\vec{v} \times \vec{w} = (v_2 w_3 - v_3w_2, \, v_3 w_1 - v_1 w_3, \, v_1 w_2 - v_2 w_1). \tag{3.136}
$$

This also has a determinant formulation:

$$
\vec{v} \times \vec{w} 
= \det\begin{pmatrix}
\hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\
v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \\
w_1 & w_2 & w_3
\end{pmatrix}
= (v_2w_3 - v_3w_2)\,\hat{i} + (v_3w_1 - v_1w_3)\,\hat{j} + (v_1w_2 - v_2w_1)\,\hat{k}. \tag{3.137}
$$

We also learned about parametrizing surfaces, and how these parametrizations came in handy when computing surface integrals. We have the formula:

$$
\iint_R dA 
= \iint_R \left\lVert \frac{\partial \vec{r}}{\partial u} \times \frac{\partial \vec{r}}{\partial v} \right\rVert du \, dv
= \text{Area of } R. \tag{3.138}
$$

## Ask Yourself

**Question 1**  
Remember how we always chose an orientation for our line integrals?  
What do you think happens when we take the *opposite* orientation?

**Question 2**  
Can you relate these surface integrals to integrals you've done in the past (i.e. line integrals and standard integrals)?
