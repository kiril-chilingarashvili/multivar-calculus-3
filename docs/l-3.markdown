## Big Picture

In this lecture, we learned about the cross product and how to compute it, and how to compute surface integrals by summing small parallelograms together.

---

## Mechanics

We learned a formula for the cross product, given by  

$$
\vec{v} \times \vec{w} = (v_2 w_3 - v_3w_2, \, v_3 w_1 - v_1 w_3, \, v_1 w_2 - v_2 w_1). \tag{3.136}
$$

This also has a determinant formulation:

$$
\vec{v} \times \vec{w} 
= \det\begin{pmatrix}
\hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\
v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \\
w_1 & w_2 & w_3
\end{pmatrix}
= (v_2w_3 - v_3w_2)\,\hat{i} + (v_3w_1 - v_1w_3)\,\hat{j} + (v_1w_2 - v_2w_1)\,\hat{k}. \tag{3.137}
$$

We also learned about parametrizing surfaces, and how these parametrizations came in handy when computing surface integrals. We have the formula:

$$
\iint_R dA 
= \iint_R \left\lVert \frac{\partial \vec{r}}{\partial u} \times \frac{\partial \vec{r}}{\partial v} \right\rVert du \, dv
= \text{Area of } R. \tag{3.138}
$$

## Ask Yourself

**Question 1**  
Remember how we always chose an orientation for our line integrals?  
What do you think happens when we take the *opposite* orientation?

---

**Question 2**  
Can you relate these surface integrals to integrals you've done in the past (i.e. line integrals and standard integrals)?

## Cross Product: Algebraic Properties

In fact, the general cross product is completely determined by the cross product for standard unit vectors computed above, by virtue of the fact that cross product has the property of **bilinearity**:

### Theorem 3

If $\vec{u}, \vec{v},$ and $\vec{w}$ are vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and if $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, then:

$$
(a \vec{u} + b \vec{v}) \times \vec{w} \;=\; a (\vec{u} \times \vec{w}) + b (\vec{v} \times \vec{w})
$$

$$
\vec{w} \times (a \vec{u} + b \vec{v}) \;=\; a (\vec{w} \times \vec{u}) + b (\vec{w} \times \vec{v}) \tag{3.100}
$$

Indeed, learners are encouraged to carry out the computational exercise of using bilinearity to derive, from the cross products between $\hat{i}, \hat{j},$ and $\hat{k}$, the general formula in our definition:

$$
(u_1 \hat{i} + u_2 \hat{j} + u_3 \hat{k}) \times (v_1 \hat{i} + v_2 \hat{j} + v_3 \hat{k})
= (u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2)\,\hat{i} \;-\; (u_1 v_3 - u_3 v_1)\,\hat{j} \;+\; (u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1)\,\hat{k} \tag{3.101}
$$
