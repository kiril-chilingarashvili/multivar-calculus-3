This lecture explores the meaning and implications of **Stokes' Theorem**, which relates line integrals around closed curves to surface integrals of the curl of a vector field. It also examines when a vector field is conservative, the role of *simple connectivity*, and why the result of a Stokes-type computation does not depend on the surface chosen.

### Objectives

By the end of this lecture and recitation, you will be able to:

- **Apply** Stokes' Theorem to compute a line integral by evaluating a surface integral of the curl of a vector field.
- **Identify** when a vector field is conservative based on its curl and whether the region is simply connected.
- **Explain** the role of simple connectivity in ensuring that a curl-free vector field is conservative.
- **Justify** why different surfaces bounded by the same curve yield the same result in Stokes' Theorem under appropriate conditions.

### Statement of Stokes' Theorem

If a closed curve $C$ bounds a surface $S$, and the curve and surface are oriented compatibly, then the line integral of a vector field $\mathbf{F}$ along $C$ can be expressed instead as a surface integral—specifically, as the flux of the vector field $\nabla \times \mathbf{F}$ through $S$.

$$
\oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \iint_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot \hat{n} \, dS
$$

Line integrals are evaluated along a curve by expressing all quantities in terms of a single parameter, leading to an ordinary one-variable integral. Surface integrals, in contrast, depend on two parameters and involve the dot product of $\nabla \times \mathbf{F}$ with $\hat{n} dS$.

### Simple Connectivity and Conservative Fields

If a vector field is defined on a simply connected region and its curl is zero, then it is a gradient field. In such cases, the line integral of the vector field is independent of the path taken between two points.

A region in space is *simply connected* if every closed curve within the region bounds a surface that lies entirely within the region.

- **Example 1:** Three-dimensional space with the origin removed is still simply connected, as any curve avoiding the origin can be continuously deformed to lie on a surface within the region.
- **Example 2:** Space with the $z$-axis removed is **not** simply connected. For instance, a circle in the $xy$-plane around the origin cannot bound a surface that remains entirely within the region (without intersecting the $z$-axis).

This lack of simple connectivity can cause vector fields with zero curl to fail to be conservative, as line integrals around paths encircling the missing axis can yield different values.

### Theorems on Curl and Gradient Fields

**Theorem 11:**  If $\mathbf{F} = \nabla f$ (where $f$ is continuously differentiable), then:

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = 0
$$

This follows from the equality of mixed second partial derivatives.

**Theorem 12:**  If $\mathbf{F}$ is defined in a simply connected region and $\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = 0$, then $\mathbf{F}$ is a gradient field.

This implies that the line integral of $\mathbf{F}$ is path-independent, and a potential function $f$ exists such that $\mathbf{F} = \nabla f$.

### Path Independence Proof via Stokes' Theorem

Assume $\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = 0$, and let $C_1$ and $C_2$ be two paths from a point $P_0$ to a point $P_1$. Consider the difference:

$$
\int_{C_1} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} - \int_{C_2} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}
$$

This corresponds to the integral over the closed curve $C$ formed by following $C_1$ and then $C_2$ in reverse:

$$
\oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}
$$

By Stokes' Theorem:

$$
\oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \iint_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot \hat{n} \, dS
$$

Since $\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = 0$, the surface integral is zero:

$$
\iint_S 0 \cdot \hat{n} \, dS = 0
$$

Hence,

$$
\int_{C_1} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \int_{C_2} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}
$$

Thus, line integrals of $\mathbf{F}$ are path-independent. This argument requires that the region be simply connected to ensure the existence of a surface $S$ bounded by $C$.

### Topological Context: Simple Connectivity

Simple connectivity is part of a broader topological framework. In topology, whether a closed loop on a surface bounds a region plays a key role in classifying surfaces.

- **Sphere:** Simply connected. Every closed curve bounds a surface on the sphere.
- **Torus (doughnut surface):** Not simply connected. A loop around the central hole cannot bound any surface entirely within the torus.

Each independent, non-bounding loop is a *topological invariant* that helps classify surfaces. For a torus, there are two such independent loops.

### Non-Orientable Surfaces and Stokes' Theorem

Consider a curve that spirals around the $z$-axis twice with a half-twist. A Möbius strip could be constructed as a surface bounded by this curve, but it presents a problem: it is **non-orientable**.

A Möbius strip has only one side and no consistent normal vector $\hat{n}$ across its entire surface. Since Stokes' Theorem requires a globally defined orientation, it cannot be applied to non-orientable surfaces like the Möbius strip or Klein bottle.

However, one can instead construct an **orientable surface** bounded by the same curve—for example, by combining a hemisphere with a narrow twisted extension. This alternative surface allows Stokes' Theorem to be applied properly, since it provides a consistent orientation.

### Surface Independence in Stokes' Theorem

A natural question arises: why does it not matter which surface we choose when applying Stokes' Theorem? It seems we can select any surface bounded by a given curve $C$, and the result remains unchanged.

Suppose we have a curve $C$ in space and choose two surfaces, $S_1$ and $S_2$, both bounded by $C$. Then:

$$
\oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \iint_{S_1} (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot \hat{n} \, dS = \iint_{S_2} (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot \hat{n} \, dS
$$

This implies that the flux of the curl of a vector field through a surface depends only on its boundary, not the specific surface chosen.

To see why, consider the difference:

$$
\iint_{S_1} (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot \hat{n} \, dS - \iint_{S_2} (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot \hat{n} \, dS
$$

Let $S$ be the closed surface formed by $S_1$ (positive orientation) and $S_2$ (negative orientation). By the Divergence Theorem:

$$
\iint_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot \hat{n} \, dS = \iiint_V \nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \, dV
$$

Since for any smooth vector field $\mathbf{F}$,

$$
\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) = 0,
$$

we conclude that the surface integrals are equal. Hence, Stokes' Theorem is independent of the chosen surface.

Verification:

Let $\mathbf{F} = (F_x, F_y, F_z)$. Then

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = \left( \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial z}, \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial y} \right)
$$

Taking the divergence:

$$
\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial z} \right) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left( \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial x} \right) + \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left( \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial y} \right)
$$

Simplifying:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 F_z}{\partial y \partial x} - \frac{\partial^2 F_y}{\partial z \partial x} + \frac{\partial^2 F_x}{\partial z \partial y} - \frac{\partial^2 F_z}{\partial x \partial y} + \frac{\partial^2 F_y}{\partial x \partial z} - \frac{\partial^2 F_x}{\partial y \partial z} = 0
$$

This vanishes due to the equality of mixed partial derivatives.

### Geometric Interpretation

This can be seen geometrically: for two vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$,

$$
\mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}) = 0
$$

since $\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}$ is perpendicular to $\mathbf{u}$. Analogously, $\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) = 0$.

### Summary of Key Ideas

1. **Stokes' Theorem Connects Line and Surface Integrals**
   $$
   \oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \iint_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot \hat{n} \, dS
   $$

2. **Zero Curl Implies Path Independence**
   In simply connected regions, if $\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = 0$, then $\mathbf{F}$ is conservative.

3. **Role of Simple Connectivity**
   Ensures that every loop bounds a surface entirely within the region, guaranteeing path independence.

4. **Surface Independence**
   The result of Stokes' Theorem depends only on the boundary curve $C$, not the specific surface bounded by it.
