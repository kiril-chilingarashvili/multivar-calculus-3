title: Parametrizing Surfaces - Part 1
primary: true
---

## Big Picture

In this lecture, we learned how to apply parametrizations to surfaces.  
This extended the notion of parametric curves one dimension higher.

## Parametrizations

Given a surface of the form  


$$

z = f(x,y),

$$


a common parameterization we used was  


$$

\begin{aligned}
x &= x \\
y &= y \\
z &= f(x,y)
\end{aligned} \tag{3.59}

$$


Note that parametrizations are not unique!  
Just like there were many parametrizations of a curve (e.g.,  


$$

r(t) = (t, t, t)

$$


and  


$$

r(t) = (t^2, t^2, t^2)

$$


describe the same curve), there are many (actually an infinite number) ways to parametrize a surface.

We also learned about cylindrical coordinates, where we would take the parametrization  


$$

\begin{aligned}
x &= r \cos(\theta) \\
y &= r \sin(\theta) \\
z &= z
\end{aligned} \tag{3.60}

$$

In the next lecture, we will go over spherical coordinates.

## Ask Yourself

---

**Question 1**  
When might it be easier to use cylindrical coordinates?

---

**Question 2**  
Given two parametrizations, how might you go from one parametrization to the other?  
It might turn out that the parametrization you are using is hard to work with, so using a different one might make your life easier!
